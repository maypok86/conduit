## :white_check_mark: Checklist for your Pull Request

<!--
Ideally a PR has all of the checkmarks set.

If something in this list is irrelevant to your PR, you should still set this
checkmark indicating that you are sure it is dealt with (be that by irrelevance).

If you don't set a checkmark (e. g. don't add a test for new functionality),
you must be able to justify that.

#### Related changes (conditional)

- Tests
  - [ ] If I added new functionality, I added tests covering it.
  - [ ] If I fixed a bug, I added a regression test to prevent the bug from
        silently reappearing again.

- Documentation
  - [ ] I checked whether I should update the docs and did so if necessary:
    - [README](../README.md)

- Public contracts
  - [ ] My changes doesn't break project license.

#### Stylistic guide (mandatory)

- [ ] My code complies with the [styles guide](https://github.com/uber-go/guide/blob/master/style.md).
- [ ] My commit history is clean (only contains changes relating to my
      issue/pull request and no reverted-my-earlier-commit changes) and commit
      messages start with identifiers of related issues in square brackets.

  **Example:** `[#42] Short commit description`

  If necessary both of these can be achieved even after the commits have been
  made/pushed using [rebase and squash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).

#### Before merging (mandatory)
